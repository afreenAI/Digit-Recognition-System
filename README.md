# Digit Recognition System using Deep Learning

This project implements a CNN-based digit recognition system capable of recognizing single and multi-digit numbers from real-world images.

## Features
- CNN trained on MNIST dataset
- Single-digit and multi-digit recognition
- Robust image preprocessing
- Digit segmentation and ordering
- Confidence score for predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Applications
- OTP recognition
- Roll number extraction
- PIN / postal code reading
- Cheque number recognition

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script:
   python multi_digit_recognition.py

## Note
The model is trained using the MNIST dataset and tested on real-world images.
